# Data-Analytics-Final-Project-Verlander
Final project for data analytics using pitches from Justin Verlanders's 2022 season 

The purpose of our project is to take Justin Verlander's pitches from his 2022 post-injury season to gain general knowledge of relationships with certain types of pitches, speed, and so on. Our project aims to and does, answer a series of questions such as speed of pitches by type of pitch, the relationship of what happens on a play by what pitch was thrown at a certain speed, if speed correlates with offensive or defensive success, and pitch count for pitch type. Overall, this project summarizes and gives an overview of Justin Verlander's 2022 season.
